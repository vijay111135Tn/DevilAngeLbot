A modular Telegram Python bot running on python3 with a sqlalchemy database and an entirely themed persona to make Saitama suitable for Anime and Manga group chats.

Can be found on telegram as [Clara](https://t.me/MissClaraBot).

The Support group can be reached out to at [Clara Bot Support ](https://t.me/MissClaraSupport), where you can ask for help about [MissClara](https://t.me/MissClaraBot), discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available.

## How to setup/deploy.


  <summary>Steps to self Host!! </summary>

  ## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):
Please make sure to use python3.6, as I cannot guarantee everything will work as expected on older Python versions!
This is because markdown parsing is done by iterating through a dict, which is ordered by default in 3.6.

  ### Configuration

There are two possible ways of configuring your bot: a config.py file, or ENV variables.

The preferred version is to use a `config.py` file, as it makes it easier to see all your settings grouped together.
This file should be placed in your `SaitamaRobot` folder, alongside the `__main__.py` file.
This is where your bot token will be loaded from, as well as your database URI (if you're using a database), and most of
your other settings.

It is recommended to import sample_config and extend the Config class, as this will ensure your config contains all
defaults set in the sample_config, hence making it easier to upgrade.

An example `config.py` file could be:
```
from SaitamaRobot.sample_config import Config

class Development(Config):
    OWNER_ID = 254318997  # your telegram ID
    OWNER_USERNAME = "SonOfLars"  # your telegram username
    API_KEY = "your bot api key"  # your api key, as provided by the @botfather
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database'  # sample db credentials
    JOIN_LOGGER = '-1234567890' # some group chat that your bot is a member of
    USE_JOIN_LOGGER = True
    DRAGONS = [18673980, 83489514]  # List of id's for users which have sudo access to the bot.
    LOAD = []
    NO_LOAD = ['translation']
```

If you can't have a config.py file (EG on Heroku), it is also possible to use environment variables.
So just go and read the config sample file.

  ### Python dependencies

Install the necessary Python dependencies by moving to the project directory and running:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

This will install all the necessary python packages.

  ### Database

If you wish to use a database-dependent module (eg: locks, notes, userinfo, users, filters, welcomes),
you'll need to have a database installed on your system. I use Postgres, so I recommend using it for optimal compatibility.

In the case of Postgres, this is how you would set up a database on a Debian/ubuntu system. Other distributions may vary.

- install postgresql:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install postgresql`

- change to the Postgres user:

`sudo su - postgres`

- create a new database user (change YOUR_USER appropriately):

`createuser -P -s -e YOUR_USER`

This will be followed by you need to input your password.
